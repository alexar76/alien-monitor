"""Hub-driven federation discovery for the Alien Monitor.

The monitor used to render a hand-written node list and only polled the hub's
``/ai-market/v2/stats/live``. New ecosystem nodes (e.g. Platon) never appeared
unless someone edited the topology by hand. This module closes that gap: it asks
the AIMarket Hub for its federation peers, reads each peer's self-declared
``/.well-known/ai-market.json`` categories, and — for nodes that advertise a
relevant capability (oracle / simulation / math-viz / randomness-beacon) — emits
a graph node hydrated with live metrics from the peer's ``/api/health`` (κ,
order_parameter, …). Nothing is hardcoded; a node appears the moment the hub
knows about it.

Security (the monitor fetches URLs the hub hands it, so they are untrusted):
  * SSRF guard — private/loopback/link-local/metadata ranges are blocked by
    default (opt in with allow_private for local universe sims). DNS is resolved,
    every returned IP is checked, and IPv6-embedded IPv4 forms (mapped, 6to4,
    NAT64, v4-compatible) are decoded and re-checked. For plain-HTTP peers the
    connection is **pinned to the vetted IP** (Host header preserved) so a
    rebind between the check and httpx's own resolution cannot reach an internal
    address (closes the classic getaddrinfo/connect TOCTOU for the http path).
  * Hard per-request and per-peer wall-clock deadlines (asyncio.wait_for) on top
    of httpx's per-read timeout, so a slowloris peer dribbling bytes can never
    hang the monitor tick or hold the state lock.
  * Response-size caps, JSON content-type required, redirects disabled, bounded
    fan-out + concurrency, a (url, allow_private)-keyed TTL cache, and strict
    numeric coercion (only finite, magnitude-bounded scalars reach node.metrics,
    which the frontend types as Record<string, number>).
  * Fault isolation — one bad/slow/malicious peer can never break the graph.
